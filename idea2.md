My second idea is to create an animation about shooting stars from space hitting a city. This will be an interactive animation
rather than a game. What the player needs to do is to control the mouse to put off the fire that the shooting stars created. 
There will be some sound effects when the shooting stars come and destroy the city. There will also be some sound effects when
the player clicks the right key to pour water and cease the fire. To better emphasize how powerful the shooting stars and the
fires are, the setting of the scene will be a city's night.
