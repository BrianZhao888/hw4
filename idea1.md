My first idea is to create a shooting game. There will be a target, a gun aim, and a field. The target will be a character
always moving on the field and player needs to control the gun with the mouse to shoot at the character. One thing about the
control of this game is that the gun will only fire when the "j" key is pressed. And to make the game more challenging and
interesting, I decided to make the gun a non-machine gun, it does not fire continuosly, it will take some time to shoot 
the next bullet. Sounds will play when the gun fires, the target was hit, and gun was reloaded. The target will have a 
HP bar,when the HP bar becomes empty, the player will win. The target will also counter attack the player and if the 
character made three counter attacks, the game will be over.
